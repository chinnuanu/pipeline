DevOps is not just about automated tooling, people and process DevOps expect to see a high premium placed on openness and transparency
*DevOps is not a framework or a workflow. It's a culture that is overtaking the business world. 
*DevOps ensures collaboration and communication between software engineers (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). 
Advantages --- With DevOps, changes make it to production faster. Resources are easier to share. And large-scale systems are easier to manage and maintain.



* Culture is driven by behavior. Culture exists among people with a mutual understanding of each other where they're coming from. Early on in IT organizations, we split teams into two majors groups. 
  Development, they were charged with creating features. And operations they were charged with maintaining stability

*Automation is a critical part of our DevOps journey. Once you begin to understand your culture, 
  you can create a fabric of automation that allows you to control your systems and your applications. 

*DevOps strongly advises you to measure key metrics across the organization.

*Sharing ideas and problems is the heart of collaboration. 
  And it's also really the heart of DevOps

*tells us that we should make sure to focus on the overall outcome of the entire pipeline or value chain. 
  It's easy to make the mistake of optimizing one part of that chain at the expense of overall results.

*The second way, amplifying feedback loops, is all about creating, shortening, and 
 amplifying feedback loops between the parts of the organization that are in the flow of that value chain. 

*A feedback loop is simply a process that takes its own output into consideration when deciding what to do next

*The third way reminds us to create a work culture that allows for both continuous experimentation and learning.

Use the third way, a culture of continuous experimentation and learning, when creating team processes and standards, and as part of your leadership style.
 Encourage sharing and trying new ideas. Engineers are problem finders and problem solvers by nature.
